# ToDo-App

This small project is a basic todo-app. In this project I practiced the relationship between data (saved in arrays and objects) and the DOM. This is just a toy app, therefore no backend data was saved.

# Functionalities
- The user is able to create projects
- The user is able to add todos to the projects
- The user is able to add notes to each todo
- The user can delete notes, todos and projects
- The user can check and uncheck their todos

## Challenges
- The most difficult part was to connect the relationships between the data and the dom (e.g. "a project has many todos").
